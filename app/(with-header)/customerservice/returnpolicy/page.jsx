            <li>
               It takes time for you and your new mattress to get used to
              each other. That's why we give you up to 30 days to be sure you're
              compatible. If the chemistry isn't right, simply come back and
              choose another mattress.
            </li>
            <li>
               We will exchange the mattress once during this 90-day
              period (from the date of purchase). Please ensure that the
              mattress you want to exchange is in clean, hygienic (not altered
              from its original form) and unstained condition.
            </li>
            <li>
               The mattress that you wish to exchange must be selected
              from our full price mattress range. If the new mattress is higher
              in price you will need to pay the difference, if the mattress you
              select is lower in price the difference will be refunded to you on
              an AYATRIO gift card.
