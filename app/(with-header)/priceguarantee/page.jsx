            At AYATRIO you get low prices every day! Find all you need to know
            about a product on the price tag in store or on the product pages of
            this website. Whether it's what a product is made from, its size
            assembled or packaged, the how-to-care instructions, or of course
            the price.

            "To design a desk which costs $1,000 is easy for a furniture
            designer, but to design a functional and good desk which costs $50
            can only be done by the very best." - Ingvar Kamprad, founder of
            AYATRIO

                When you check-out you will see the delivery costs and have the
                option to add assembly. (Remember, AYATRIO products are designed
                to be easy to assemble, so if you don't want to pay why not give
                it a try?)
