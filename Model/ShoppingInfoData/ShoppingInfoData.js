Our room settings are built entirely from AYATRIO products and will give you inspired ideas for furnishing, lighting, and decorating your home. All products at the store have a price tag, which shows important information about size, color, material, measurements, features, and care. Tags on large items tell you where to pick them up in the self-serve furniture area. If you need, you can talk to our sales co-workers who can answer your questions or offer you additional home furnishing advice."
